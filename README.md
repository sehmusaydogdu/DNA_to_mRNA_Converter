One strand of genomic DNA (strand A,coding strand) contains the following sequence reading from 5' - to 3' -;

5’- TCGTCGACGATGATCATCGGCTTACTCGA – 3’

This strand will form the following duplex (replication)

5’- TCGTCGACGATGATCATCGGCTTACTCGA – 3’

3'- AGCAGCUGCUACUAGUAGCCGAAUGAGCU - 5'

The sequence of bases in the other strand of DNA (strand B) written 5’ – to 3’ – is therefore

TCGTCGACGATGATCATCGGCTTACTCGA

The sequence of bases in the mRNA transcribed from strand A of DNA written 5’ – to 3 ‘ is
